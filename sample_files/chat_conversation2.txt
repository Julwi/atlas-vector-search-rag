Tim: Hi, can you explain what is RAG in databases? Julian: Hi Tim, Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that addresses the limitations of LLMs by providing them with access to contextual, up-to-date data. RAG implementations, sometimes referred to as RAG models or patterns, work by combining a pre-trained LLM with a retrieval system of readily accessible information. The retrieval system is responsible for finding relevant information from a knowledge library, such as a database. The RAG models enable the LLM, or foundation model, to generate a more accurate answer with up-to-date and relevant context to the task at hand. RAG can also be used to allow a generative AI powered application to observe some background state, and tailor its generations accordingly. An example would be the ability to write code based on the code that a user is writing.
